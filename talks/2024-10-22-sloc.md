> \> The code works, seems it is returning valid values

It doesn't. There are two crucial errors in the routine, and you can
see them both in this assignment:

```
    # Make a copy of i-th column vector from matrix m
    cvt = m[i]
```

That's not a copy, and it's not a column vector.
It's a read-write view to a row vector, and among other effects this ends up
producing an `m` that is fully broadcast-assigned to `v`,
which was not your intent.

We now have to guess which is the truth and which is a lie --- the comments or the code.

# separation of concerns

We would like to be able to swap in one or another module,
based on current filetype, similar to these shell pipelines:

```bash
$ cat example1.php | filter_php_comments.sh |
    filter_blank_lines.sh | wc -l

$ cat example2.C   | filter_cxx_comments.sh |
    filter_blank_lines.sh | wc -l
```
