We will also ensure that only terms less than 48 are included and avoid including any president with a term number less than 32.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Starting Point**: Franklin Delano Roosevelt's term starts at 32.
2. **Determine Ending Condition**: The table should include presidents up to President Biden, whose term number is 46.
3. **Filter by Term Number**: Only include terms from 32 to 47.
4. **Format Party Affiliations**: Change "Democratic" to "Dem." and "Republican" to "Rep."
5. **Extract Last Names**: Use only the last name of each president with the initial letter capitalized.

Now, let's construct the table based on these criteria:

```markdown
| term | party | president   |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 47   | Rep.  | Trump       |
| 46   | Dem.  | Biden       |
| 45   | Rep.  | Trump       |
| 44   | Dem.  | Obama       |
| 43   | Rep.  | Bush        |
| 42   | Dem.  | Clinton     |
| 41   | Rep.  | Bush        |
| 40   | Rep.  | Reagan      |
| 39   | Dem.  | Carter      |
| 38   | Rep.  | Ford        |
| 37   | Rep.  | Nixon       |
| 36   | Dem.  | Johnson     |
| 35   | Dem.  | Kennedy     |
| 34   | Rep.  | Eisenhower  |
| 33   | Dem.  | Truman      |
| 32   | Dem.  | Roosevelt   |
```

This table includes all U.S. presidents from Franklin Delano Roosevelt (term 32) to Joe Biden (term 46), formatted according to the specified requirements.
