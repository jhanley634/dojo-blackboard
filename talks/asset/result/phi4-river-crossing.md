1. **Initial State:**
   - Left Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves, 5 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Canoe

2. **Move 1:**
   - Farmer takes 2 wolves across.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 5 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Farmer, 2 Wolves
   - Canoe returns alone.

3. **Move 2:**
   - Farmer takes 2 wolves across again.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 5 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Farmer, 4 Wolves
   - Canoe returns with 1 wolf.

4. **Move 3:**
   - Farmer takes 2 sheep across.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 3 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves, 2 Sheep

5. **Move 4:**
   - Farmer returns alone.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 3 Sheep, Farmer
   - Right Bank: 3 Wolves, 2 Sheep

6. **Move 5:**
   - Farmer takes 2 sheep across.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 1 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves, 4 Sheep

7. **Move 6:**
   - Farmer returns with 1 sheep.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 2 Sheep, Farmer
   - Right Bank: 3 Wolves, 3 Sheep

8. **Move 7:**
   - Farmer takes 2 wolves across.
   - Left Bank: 1 Wolf, 2 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Farmer, 5 Wolves, 3 Sheep

9. **Move 8:**
   - Canoe returns with 1 wolf.
   - Left Bank: 2 Wolves, 2 Sheep
   - Right Bank: 4 Wolves, 3 Sheep, Farmer

10. **Move 9:**
    - Farmer takes 2 sheep across.
    - Left Bank: 2 Wolves
    - Right Bank: Farmer, 4 Wolves, 5 Sheep

11. **Move 10:**
    - Canoe returns alone.
    - Left Bank: 2 Wolves
    - Right Bank: Farmer, 4 Wolves, 5 Sheep

12. **Move 11:**
    - Farmer takes 2 wolves across.
    - Left Bank: No animals
    - Right Bank: Farmer, 6 Wolves, 5 Sheep

**Verification:**

- At no point were sheep outnumbered by wolves on either bank without the farmer present.
- The final state has all animals safely on the right bank.
