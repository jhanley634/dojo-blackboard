Please note that the table includes all U.S. presidents since FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt), which corresponds to term number 32, up to the most recent president at the time of this knowledge cutoff in 2023. The "Other" category is included for presidents who were not affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican parties, such as George Washington, who was nonpartisan as political parties did not exist in the same form during his presidency. For simplicity and as per your request, the table does not include presidents prior to FDR or those with third party affiliations other than explicitly noted.
