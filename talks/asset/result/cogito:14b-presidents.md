1) First, let's identify the starting point: term = 32 (Herbert Hoover)
2) Then, go up to term = 47 (Donald Trump), since we need terms < 48

Here's the resulting markdown table:

| term | party | president |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 47   | Rep.  | Trump     |
| 46   | Dem.  | Biden     |
| 45   | Rep.  | Trump     |
| 44   | Dem.  | Obama     |
| 43   | Rep.  | Bush      |
| 42   | Dem.  | Clinton   |
| 41   | Rep.  | Bush      |
| 40   | Rep.  | Reagan    |
| 39   | Dem.  | Carter    |
| 38   | Rep.  | Ford      |
| 37   | Rep.  | Nixon     |
| 36   | Dem.  | Johnson   |
| 35   | Dem.  | Kennedy   |
| 34   | Rep.  | Eisenhower|
| 33   | Dem.  | Truman    |
| 32   | Dem.  | Roosevelt |

This table includes all presidents from term 32 through 47, excludes Hoover (term < 32), and uses "Other" party where necessary but in this case none were needed as the parties have been converted to standard abbreviations.
