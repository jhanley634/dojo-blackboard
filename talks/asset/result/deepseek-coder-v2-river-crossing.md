Let's break down the sequence of moves step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - Left Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves, 5 Sheep
   - Right Bank: Empty

2. **First Move:**
   - The farmer takes the first trip to the right bank with any two animals (since he can take up to two). Let's start by taking 2 sheep across.
   - New State: Left Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves; Right Bank: 2 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 1

3. **Second Move:**
   - The farmer returns alone to the left bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves; Right Bank: 2 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 2

4. **Third Move:**
   - The farmer takes 1 wolf across to the right bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 1 Sheep, 2 Wolves; Right Bank: 3 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 3

5. **Fourth Move:**
   - The farmer returns alone to the left bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 1 Sheep, 2 Wolves; Right Bank: 3 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 4

6. **Fifth Move:**
   - The farmer takes 1 sheep across to the right bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 2 Sheep, 2 Wolves; Right Bank: 4 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 5

7. **Sixth Move:**
   - The farmer returns alone to the left bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 2 Sheep, 2 Wolves; Right Bank: 4 Sheep, 1 Wolf
   - Move Count: 6

8. **Seventh Move:**
   - The farmer takes both wolves across to the right bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 2 Sheep; Right Bank: 6 Sheep, 3 Wolves
   - Move Count: 7

9. **Eighth Move:**
   - The farmer returns alone to the left bank.
   - New State: Left Bank: 2 Sheep; Right Bank: 6 Sheep, 3 Wolves
   - Move Count: 8

10. **Ninth Move:**
    - The farmer takes both sheep across to the right bank.
    - New State: Right Bank: 8 Sheep, 3 Wolves
    - Move Count: 9

After these moves, all animals are safely on the right bank without any wolves eating any sheep. The minimum number of moves required is 9.

FINAL ANSWER: 9
I hope this final answer is correct.
