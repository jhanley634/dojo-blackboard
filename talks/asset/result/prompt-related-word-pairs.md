related word pairs

Create a dozen pairs of related words, such as {taper, tapper}, where doubling the consonant changes the vowel sound. In the example it changes from long A to a short A sound.

Each word must be two or three syllables long.
Both words must have the identical ending.
So do not e.g. append an -ed or -ly or -ing suffix to alter a word.
