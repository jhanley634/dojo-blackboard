The key constraint is that the canoe can only carry the farmer plus at most two animals at a time.

Here's a sequence of moves that achieves the goal:

1. Farmer takes canoe to right bank.
2. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
3. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with one sheep.
4. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
5. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with another sheep.
6. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
7. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with the remaining sheep.
8. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
9. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with one wolf.
10. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
11. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with the next wolf.
12. Farmer returns to left bank with canoe.
13. Farmer takes canoe to right bank with the last wolf.
14. Farmer remains on the right bank.

Verification:

- After Move 1: Right bank has 1 farmer, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 4 sheep.
- After Move 2: Right bank has 1 farmer, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 3 sheep.
- After Move 3: Right bank has 1 farmer, 1 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 2 sheep.
- After Move 4: Right bank has 1 farmer, 1 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 1 sheep.
- After Move 5: Right bank has 1 farmer, 2 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 0 sheep.
- After Move 6: Right bank has 1 farmer, 2 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 0 sheep.
- After Move 7: Right bank has 1 farmer, 3 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 0 sheep.
- After Move 8: Right bank has 1 farmer, 3 sheep, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 3 wolves, 0 sheep.
- After Move 9: Right bank has 1 farmer, 1 wolf, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 2 wolves, 3 sheep.
- After Move 10: Right bank has 1 farmer, 1 wolf, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 2 wolves, 2 sheep.
- After Move 11: Right bank has 1 farmer, 2 wolves, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 1 wolf, 2 sheep.
- After Move 12: Right bank has 1 farmer, 2 wolves, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 1 wolf, 1 sheep.
- After Move 13: Right bank has 1 farmer, 3 wolves, Left bank has 1 canoe, 1 farmer, 0 wolves, 1 sheep.

In this solution, 13 moves were made to transport each animal safely while ensuring that no sheep were eaten by the wolves at any point. Throughout these moves, sheep always outnumbered wolves when they were on the left bank, and the farmer ensured no sheep were eaten when on the right bank.

FINAL ANSWER: The minimum number of moves the farmer must make is 13. I hope this final answer is correct.
