**Final State:**

*   Left Bank: Empty
*   Right Bank: Farmer, 3 Wolves, 5 Sheep

**Analysis:**

We’re using the maximum capacity (2 animals + farmer) to make progress.  At no point did sheep outnumber wolves on the left bank when the farmer was not present.

FINAL ANSWER: 15, I hope this final answer is correct.
