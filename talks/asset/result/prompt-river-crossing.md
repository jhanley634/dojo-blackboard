river crossing


On the left bank of a river we see

- a canoe
- 1 farmer
- 3 wolves
- 5 sheep

The two locations are the: left bank and the right bank.

The canoe can accommodate the farmer plus, at most, two animals.

If the farmer is at a location, no sheep will be eaten.
If sheep outnumber wolves at a location, no sheep will be eaten.
Otherwise wolves will eat sheep, for example if 1 wolf and 1 sheep are alone on a bank.


The farmer makes a  sequence of moves to safely arrange for all animals to be on the right bank.
No sheep should be eaten by wolves.
After the final move we should see 3 wolves and 5 sheep in the right bank.
A "move" is a trip from left to right bank, or a trip from right to left bank.
What is the minimum number of moves he must make?
Verify that each move is valid, and that no sheep are eaten.

On the last line of your answer, display FINAL ANSWER, the number of moves, and the
text "I hope this final answer is correct."
