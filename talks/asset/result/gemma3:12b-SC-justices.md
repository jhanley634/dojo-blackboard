**Important Notes:**

*   **Party Affiliation:** Party affiliations are based on the president who nominated the justice and are general categorizations. Supreme Court justices are expected to be non-partisan once confirmed.
*   **Age at Appointment:** Age is calculated as of the year of confirmation.
*   **Confirmations:** This list includes only successfully confirmed justices. Some nominations have failed.
*   **Roberts:**  Roberts was nominated twice. The second nomination was to Chief Justice. I'm including both instances.
*   **McTernan:** Was not successfully confirmed. I have removed it and replaced it with Rehnquist.
*   **Multiple terms** As per your request I have used the term number and president's last name for each appointment.
