```markdown
| Term | Party | President |
|---|---|---|
| 46 | Rep. | Trump |
| 45 | Dem. | Obama |
| 44 | Rep. | Bush |
| 43 | Dem. | Clinton |
| 42 | Rep. | Bush |
| 41 | Dem. | Carter |
| 40 | Rep. | Ford |
| 39 | Dem. | Johnson |
| 38 | Rep. | Nixon |
| 37 | Dem. | Kennedy |
| 36 | Rep. | Eisenhower |
| 35 | Dem. | Truman |
| 34 | Dem. | Roosevelt |
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Reverse Chronological Order:** The table is ordered from the most recent president (Trump) to Franklin D. Roosevelt.
*   **Term:**  This is based on the numbering from Washington as 1, to Obama as 44, and continuing the count for subsequent presidents.
*   **Party:**  Lists the dominant party affiliation.
*   **President:**  Just the last name for brevity.

I have added the most recent two presidents as well.  Let me know if you would like any adjustments or additional information!
