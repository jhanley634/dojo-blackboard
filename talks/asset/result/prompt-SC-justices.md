I'm interested in recent US supreme court appointments: number,
year appointed, age at appointment, party affiliation of president,
term number of president, name of president, name of justice.

The number column starts at 20 for the most recent justice, and counts down to 1.

Give just the last name of the president, and just the last name of the justice.
G. Bush was presidential term number 41, G. H. W. Bush was 43, Trump was 45 and again 47.
Only consider justices who ultimately were successfully confirmed by the Senate.

Present it in tabular form, with column headings of year, age, party, term, president, justice.
Choose one of {Dem., Rep.} for party.

Put it in reverse chronological order.
Be sure to list the 20 most recent appointments.
