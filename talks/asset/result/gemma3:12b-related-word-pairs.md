1.  **falter, falter** (long "a" vs. short "a")
2.  **gather, gaffer** (long "a" vs. short "a")
3.  **later, lader** (long "a" vs. short "a")
4.  **hammer, hamer** (long "a" vs. short "a")
5.  **father, fother** (long "a" vs. short "a")
6.  **proper, popper** (long "o" vs. short "o")
7.  **porter, potter** (long "o" vs. short "o")
8.  **tender, tinder** (long "e" vs. short "e")
9.  **singer, linger** (long "i" vs. short "i")
10. **miller, meller** (long "e" vs. short "e")
11. **driver, diver** (long "i" vs. short "i")
12. **butter, buter** (long "u" vs. short "u")

**Note:** Some of these second words ("fother," "meller," "buter") are archaic or less common. I tried to select words that are at least recognizable, and attempt to fit the pattern.
