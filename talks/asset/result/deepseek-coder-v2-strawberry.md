1. The word "strawberry" consists of nine letters in total. These letters are S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, Y.
2. Now, we need to specifically count the occurrences of the letter R within this word.
3. In the sequence S, T, R, A, W, B, E, R, Y, there are two instances where the letter R appears: once in the second position (after T) and once more at the last position before Y.
4. Therefore, there are exactly two R's present in the word "strawberry."
