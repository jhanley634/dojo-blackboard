```markdown
| term | party    | president |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 47   | Republican| Trump     |
| 46   | Democratic| Biden      |
| 45   | Republican| Trump     |
| 44   | Democratic| Obama     |
| 43   | Republican| Bush      |
| 42   | Democratic| Clinton   |
| 41   | Republican| Bush      |
| 40   | Republican| Reagan    |
| 39   | Democratic| Carter    |
| 38   | Republican| Ford      |
| 37   | Republican| Nixon     |
| 36   | Democratic| Johnson   |
| 35   | Democratic| Kennedy   |
| 34   | Republican| Eisenhower|
| 33   | Democratic| Truman    |
| 32   | Democratic| Roosevelt |
```

To generate this table, I first identified the relevant terms for each president and included only those with a term greater than or equal to 32. Then, I mapped the given party affiliations to either "Democratic," "Republican," or "Other" based on historical context. Finally, I formatted the names of the presidents correctly by capitalizing the first letter and ensuring that Hoover was excluded from the list.
