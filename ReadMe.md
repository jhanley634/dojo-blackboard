This repo supports the [Hacker Dojo](https://www.hackerdojo.com) Blackboard project,
developed by the local python [community](https://www.meetup.com/hackerdojo/events).
Come visit us at the Dojo on Tuesday evenings at 6:30pm to participate.

Begin by following these setup instructions.
```bash
make install
make run
```
That will create a venv virtual environment in your home directory,
and run the app within that environment.

Next step is to jump into the development [process](docs/).
